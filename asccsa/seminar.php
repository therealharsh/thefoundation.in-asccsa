			doctors, lawyers, social workers, public health experts and counsellors. CEHAT through its 

			research, intervention, education and advocacy, has been addressing issues of right to health 

			care for all; investigating and combating violence; and caring for survivors. CEHAT has

			only forms the backbone of work on this issue in India but has also paved the way for 

			incest/CSA to become a ‘field’ in the country and inspired other organisations that have come
