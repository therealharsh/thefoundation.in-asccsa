				<b>Let’s #TalkSexuality: The Whys and Hows of an Affirmative Approach to Addressing Sexuality<br>
				Facilitator: TARSHI (Tanisha Chaddha and Dipika Srivastava)<br>
				No. of Days: 1<br>
				Maximum no. of participants: 25<br>
				Suitable participants: Stakeholders working in the field, trainers, teachers</b><br>

				<b>About the workshop:</b><br>
				Children and young people growing up with accurate and matter-of-fact information and messages 
				on sexuality, are likely to have better emotional and mental health and well-being. And, people who 
				have a healthy sense of themselves make well-informed and better decisions that do people who 
				think poorly of themselves. Sexuality is often a little-understood and highly controversial topic, used 
				interchangeably with sexual intercourse or sexual orientation, when in fact it is a much broader idea. 
				Understanding sexuality involves identifying and exploring a wide range of issues, emotions, 
				experiences and topics included under its rubric. Similarly, an understanding of gender requires 
				appreciating the valuable potential of acknowledging that it is socially constructed. TARSHI’s 
				workshop will address the following:<br>
				<b>1.</b> Expanding the understanding of sex and sexuality and gender<br>
				<b>2.</b> Exploring ways of equipping oneself to be able to give affirming messages and information around 
				sexuality on children and young people, for their safety and well-being<br>

				<b>About the facilitator:</b><br>
 				TARSHI (Talking About Reproductive and Sexual Health Issues) is a registered NGO based in New 
				Delhi, India founded in 1996 that works to TARSHI support and enable people's control and 
				agency over their sexual and reproductive health and well-being through information 
				dissemination, knowledge and perspective building, within a human rights framework. TARSHI 
				believes that all people have the right to sexual well-being and to a self-affirming and enjoyable 
				sexuality and aims to address all people, especially women and young people through its various 
				programmes. For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.tarshi.net">www.tarshi.net.</a></p>

					<b>About the workshop:</b><br>
					A child protection policy (CPP) articulates an organization zero tolerance approach to child abuse. An 
					important step towards achieving this objective would be for every institution which works with and 
					for children to develop and adhere to a child protection policy which would have clear cut guidelines 
					and protocols to provide for a safe and conducive environment for both children and the adults with 
					whom they interact. The goal of this workshop is to assist participants with an understanding of 
					evolving  a policy suited to their uniqueness but within a framework of non negotiables, for reducing 
					and managing risks of child abuse by persons engaged in delivering the organization program 
					activities.<br>

					programs, creation and strengthening of support networks especially for legal assistance and 
					psychosocial healing of abused children and their families, and developing information resources.

					significant activities besides fostering coalitions and networks to influence policy and legislative
					initiatives. The strategies which underpins Tulir’s programming are designed for broad scale

				Suitable participants: Mental health professionals, therapists, and social workers</b><br>
				
				<b>About the workshop:</b><br>
				The causes of sexual abusive behaviors are varied and include both victimization experience and 
				learning from family and community behaviors and culture. Regardless of the cause, however, 
				children abusing children is a reality today. If the public and communities remain reluctant to 
				acknowledge the existence of children with abusive sexual behaviors, treatment options to stop the 
				sexual offending of these children at early ages will also remain uncertain. The aim of this workshop 
				is to look at characteristics of the 40 young sexual offenders who have come to CPTCSA for 
				treatment. With this information, we can design and implement effective services for prevention 
				and treatment that focus on the individual, family, community and culture.<br>
